    <p class="text-lg md:text-center">
      Though i write primarily in these niches, my versatility enables me to<br />
      create content across a wide range of industries
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mt-8">Why should you hire me?</h1>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium">Excellent writing skills</h2>

    <p>
      I provide valuable, orignal and well-written content. Before creating any
      content, i make sure to have a thorough understanding and sound knowledge
      about the subject matter which in this case is your business, the services
      or products you offer, how that service or product benefit your customer
      and exactly how to put together all these useful information into a well
      written piece of content.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      Another thing that stands out about my writing is my unique tone of voice,
      I don't believe in creating generic, tone-deaf content. How do I connect
      with readers if I sound like a robot? I believe in adjusting my tone of
      voice whether it be straightforward educational and informative content or
      inserting cheerful quips here and there to get a chuckle (or two) out of
      my readers. I provide content that is the right fit for your business.
      <br />
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl mt-4 font-medium">Industry expertise</h2>
    <p>
      When I'm asked why I decided to write about health, wellness, food, and
      fitness, my answer is always simple, I love it. Routines like hitting the
      gym, and eating healthy are a part of my day-to-day life so wetting about
      these niches does not seem like a chore or work to me, I'm simply writing
      about the lifestyle I love. My degree in Radiography also affords me with
      knowledge in the health sector.
      <br />
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl mt-4 font-medium">Easy to work with</h2>

    <p>
      I pride myself on being friendly and easy to work with while maintaining
      professionalism
